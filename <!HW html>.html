      <strong>Why Software Testing is Important?</strong> - 
       Software Testing is Important because if there are any 
       bugs or errors in the software, 
       it can be identified early 
       and can be solved before delivery of the software product.
       Early tested software product ensures reliability, 
       security and high performance which further 
       results in time saving, 
       cost effectiveness and customer satisfaction.
        
          
     <p> Testing is a method to check 
         whether the actual software product matches 
         expected requirements and to ensure 
         that software product is <b>Defect free.</b> 
         It involves execution of software/system components 
         using manual or automated tools to evaluate one 
         or more properties of interest. 
         The purpose of software testing is to identify errors, 
         gaps or missing requirements in contrast to
          actual requirements.</p>
